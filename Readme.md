# What is Webpack? 
## Part 1
* Bundle files from many different sources into a few files (bundle assets) / manage dependencies.
* loaders
* create-react-app and other cli's use webpack
* minified files (bundle.js, main.chunk.js) "eval" "__webpack__require__" etc.
* development and production modes
## Part 2
* Sample app -- a calculator with basic validations
* ./assets, src/app.js, index.html 
* getting a more complicated structure: break app (simple as it is) into utils
